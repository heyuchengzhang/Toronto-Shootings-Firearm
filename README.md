# Rising Firearm Violence in Toronto: Temporal Trends and Neighborhood Hotspots (2004â€“2024)

## Overview

This paper examines firearm violence in Toronto from 2004 to 2024 using Open Data Toronto to understand its temporal and geographic patterns. Findings show an upward trend in firearm-related injuries and deaths, with incidents disproportionately concentrated in neighborhoods such as Glenfield-Jane Heights and Black Creek. Linear regression models predict continued increases if patterns persist, highlighting seasonal peaks during summer months. These results aim to guide policy and community efforts to address firearm violence through localized interventions and resource allocation.
